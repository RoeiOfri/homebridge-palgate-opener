 Info returns: {<gate address>: <gate_id>
Info: [{'_id': '3G00000001', 'address': 'עזריאלי', Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel'}, 
       {'_id': '3G00000002', 'address': 'שרונה', Israel'}]
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
           Your gate ID              Gate location
```
In this example we have two gates:
1. Gate ID: 3G00000001 located at 'עזריאלי', Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel'.
2. Gate ID: 3G00000002 located at 'שרונה', Israel'.

# Plugin-in configuration

## Configure plugin via UI
1. Open your HomeBridge UI and navigate to "Plugins" tab.
2. Locate the PalGateOpener plugin and click on "Settings".
3. Follow on-screen instructions, please do so *after* extracting the gate-id and token using the extraction tool.

## Manual configuration (configuration.yaml file)
```
"accessories": [
        {
            "accessory": "PalGateOpener",
            "name": "<chosen name>",
            "accessoryType": "<garageDoor>"
            "deviceId": "<device_id>",
            "token": "<token>"
        },
        {
            "accessory": "PalGateOpener",
            "name": "<choosen name>",
            "accessoryType": "<switch>"
            "deviceId": "<device_id>",
            "token": "<token>"
        }
]
```
# Explanation
| key | Mandatory/Optional |Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `accessory` | Yes |Must be PalGateOpener |
| `name` |Yes |Chosen name to populate to HomeKit |
| `deviceId`|Yes | Gate ID extracted from CLI tool |
| `token` |Yes| Token extracted from CLI tool |
| `accessoryType`|No - Default usage: switch | switch/garageDoor* |
### Please note:
1. The default accessoryType is set to `switch`, if using `garageDoor` HomeKit with location service to open the gate
automatically when arriving home will have to be initiated by user via push notification and his approval for the automation to run.
This is a security feature by Apple.
If you wish to "bypass" it please set the `accessortyType` as `switch`.
2. You CAN duplicate the accessory so you will have one button as GarageDoor button and you will have the button also in your Apple CarPlay and a switch for the automation operation (works great BTW :))

2. When setting the `accessoryType` as `garageDoor` automation will not work independetly (as mentioned above) but you will loose the ability
to see the ability to use the Garage Door icon in Apple CarPlay.
If you wish that the gate will open automaticlly by setting location service automation please use `switch` as `accessoryType` value.

# Attention!
Obtaining token via the tool will cause Pal Gate phone APP token to be revoked hence it will no longer work for your
phone number (using the app) until you will re-sign to the Pal Gate app which will cause the HomeKit token to be revoked (thus HomeKit plugin will not work).

# FAQ
### Can I control more than one Pal Gate barriers?
Yes you can! just insert the block more than once with different name and with the same token and deviceID and it should work just fine.
### Will I still be able to use the PalGate app on my phone?
No, if you reopen the app you will be asked to re-authorize therefore the token obtained via CLI will get revoked and HomeKit will not be able communicate with the gate any more.
### Will I still be able to use voice-dial to open the gate?
Yes you can, it has nothing to do with this plugin.
### I re-signed to PalGate app and now I can't control the gate via HomeKit, what do I do?
Just re-run the tool, update the config file with the new token and you're good to go!
